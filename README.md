## Analysis of the Impact of War and Terrorism on "Islamophobia and Media Portrayals of Muslim Women"

I analyze the findings in the paper [Islamophobia and Media Portrayals of Muslim Women: A Computational Text Analysis of US News Coverage](http://rochelleterman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Manuscript.pdf) by University of Chicago Postdoctoral Fellow [Rochelle Terman](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/rochelle-terman) using [data from the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/W8AAYK&version=1.0).

Terman's paper finds that western media (specifically the New York Times and Washington Post) depicts Muslim countries as a *cultural* through an analysis of their coverage of Muslim women. By controlling for war and terrorism, I reduce the magnitude of these results by 33%.
