# The Main Point

Current news aims to affirm western cultural and political superiority over muslim countries
 - Gendered orientalism: used poor treatment of women in other countries as a definition
 	of barbaric ways. would use "freeing" these women as a rallying cry.

--
---

# Claims

- Quantity Hypothesis: The binary sepertion of Muslim Women from "freer" western women (i.e. pushing this narritive). So Muslim women from countries with poor rights records make news, while opposite for non-muslim.
- Quality Hypothesis: all else equal, coverage of muslim women focuses more on women's rights
