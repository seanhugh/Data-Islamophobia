# The Main Point

Current news aims to affirm western cultural and political superiority over muslim countries
 - Gendered orientalism: used poor treatment of women in other countries as a definition
 	of barbaric ways. would use "freeing" these women as a rallying cry.

--
---

# Claims

- Quantity Hypothesis: The binary sepertion of Muslim Women from "freer" western women (i.e. pushing this narritive). So Muslim women from countries with poor rights records make news, while opposite for non-muslim.
- Quality Hypothesis: all else equal, coverage of muslim women focuses more on women's rights

# Steps to analyze:

####1. Clean Data
- Link the data to country data using COW codes

####2. Analyze Data Quality
- Visualize Data
- Compare Outliers to existing datasets

####3. Test Hypothesis
- What occurs if we look at a non-binary indicator for number of articles?
- What are the non-muslim countries that compare when looking at status of women?
- What happens if we just include percent muslim?

# Let's analyze some variables
